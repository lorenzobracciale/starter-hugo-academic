abstract: "Background: Gathering ecological data for species of conservation concern\
  \ inhabiting remote regions can be daunting and, sometimes, logistically infeasible.\
  \ We built a custom-made GPS tracking device that allows to remotely and accurately\
  \ collect animal position, environmental, and ecological data, including animal\
  \ temperature and UVB radiation. We designed the device to track the critically\
  \ endangered Galápagos pink land iguana, Conolophus marthae. Here we illustrate\
  \ some technical solutions adopted to respond to challenges associated with such\
  \ task and present some preliminary results from controlled trial experiments and\
  \ field implementation. Results: Our tests show that estimates of temperature and\
  \ UVB radiation are affected by the design of our device, in particular by its casing.\
  \ The introduced bias, though, is systematic and can be corrected using linear and\
  \ quadratic regressions on collected values. Our data show that GPS accuracy loss,\
  \ although introduced by vegetation and orientation of the devices when attached\
  \ to the animals, is acceptable, leading to an average error gap of less than 15\
  \ m in more than 50% of the cases. Conclusions: We address some technical challenges\
  \ related to the design, construction, and operation of a custom-made GPS tracking\
  \ device to collect data on animals in the wild. Systematic bias introduced by the\
  \ technological implementation of the device exists. Understanding the nature of\
  \ the bias is crucial to provide correction models. Although designed to track land\
  \ iguanas, our device could be used in other circumstances and is particularly useful\
  \ to track organisms inhabiting locations that are difficult to reach or for which\
  \ classic telemetry approaches are unattainable. © The Author(s) 2020. This article\
