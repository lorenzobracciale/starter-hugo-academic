abstract: The aim of this extended abstract is to present Campus++, a location-based
  publish-subscribe system for intermittently connected delay tolerant networks, exploiting
  IEEE 802.15.4 devices, and taking into due account the severe constraints deriving
  from their physical characteristics. We describe our proposed architectural model
  and how we implemented our solution in a real test-bed. We point out that our system
  can be easily adapted to operate in a fully distributed, infrastructure-less way,
  allowing free communications e.g. in disaster areas or in areas in which \"usual\"
  communications means are either non existent or intentionally made unavailable.
