abstract: 'The design of wireless sensor nodes for animal tracking is a multidisciplinary
  activity that presents several research challenges both from a technical and a biological
  point of view. A monitoring device has to be designed accounting for all system
  requirements including the specific characteristics of animals and environment.
  In this work we present some aspects of the design of a wireless sensor node to
  track and monitor the pink iguana of the Galápagos: a recently discovered species
  living in remote locations at the Galápagos Islands. The few individuals of this
  species live in a relatively small area that lacks of any available communication
  infrastructure. We present and discuss the energy harvesting architecture and the
  related energy management logic. We also discuss the impact of packaging on the
  sensor performance and the consequences of the limited available energy on the GPS
  tracking. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.'
