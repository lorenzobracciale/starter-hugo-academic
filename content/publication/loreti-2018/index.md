abstract: Popular mobile apps use push notifications extensively to offer an \"always
  connected\" experience to their users. Social networking apps use them as a real-time
  channel to notify users about new private messages or new social interactions (e.g.,
  friendship request, tagging, etc.). Despite the cryptography used to protect these
  communication channels, the strict temporal binding between the actions that trigger
  the notifications and the reception of the notification messages in the mobile device
  may represent a privacy issue. In this work, we present the push notification attack
  designed to bind the physical owners of mobile devices with their virtual identities,
  even if pseudonyms are used. In an online attack, an active attacker triggers a
  push notification and captures the notification packets that transit in the network.
  In an offline attack, a passive attacker correlates the social network activity
  of a user with the received push notification. The push notification attack bypasses
  the standard ways of protecting user privacy based on the network layer by operating
  at the application level. It requires no additional software on the victim's mobile
  device. Â© 2018 by the author.
