abstract: 'Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6 in short) is a networking architecture
  suitable for both IP backbones and datacenters. The research, standardization and
  implementation of this architecture are actively progressing and SRv6 is already
  adopted in a number of large scale deployments. Effective solutions for Performance
  Monitoring (PM) of SRv6 networks are strongly needed and there is a lot of activity
  in this area. A full blown Performance Monitoring solution needs to include: i)
  Data Plane (as needed to measure metrics such as packet loss and delay); ii) Control
  Plane (to send commands to the monitoring entities in the nodes); iii) Management
  Plane (e.g., to collect the measured metrics). Moreover, Big-Data tools and solutions
  can be applied inside or above the traditional Management Plane boundaries to store
  and analyze the collected data. In this article we describe SRv6-PM, a solution
  for Performance Monitoring of SRv6 networks that deals with all the aspects discussed
  above. SRv6-PM features a cloud-native architecture that supports: i) the ingestion,
  processing, storage and visualization of PM data using Big-Data tools; ii) the SDN-based
  control of network routers to drive the performance monitoring operations. In particular,
  we focus on Loss Monitoring and consider a solution capable of tracking single packet
  loss events operating in near-real time (e.g., with a time granularity in the order
  of 10-20 seconds). SRv6-PM is released as open source. We offer a re-usable and
  extensible platform that can be automatically deployed in different environments,
  from a single host to multiple servers on private/public clouds and includes a set
  of Big-Data tools and the SDN control plane. We also provide a reproducible Data
  Plane environment for PM experiments in SRv6 networks based on the Mininet emulator.
