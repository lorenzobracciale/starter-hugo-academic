abstract: 'A careful planning of sleeping activities is essential for guaranteeing
  long operational time to energy constrained IoT devices, given the extremely low
  energy consumption required during the sleeping mode. Neighbor discovery instead
  requires nodes to continuously listen to the radio channel to detect potential and
  unpredictable messages coming from the arrival of new nodes. These two contrasting
  needs raise a fundamental question: Should a node be active and listen to the channel
  or sleep and save energy? Hardware manufacturers introduced dedicated low-power
  circuitry to allow an energy efficient fast duty cycle (Wake-on Radio) or designed
  to wake up the main processor when special packets are received (Wake-up Radio).
  In this work, we propose a novel analytic model optimizing the number of discovered
  peers for a given energy budget. Our theoretical study demonstrates the existence
  of an optimum duty cycle in a wide range of operating environments. We designed
  an adaptive algorithm that dynamically tracks the optimum even in non-stationary
  conditions, only using local device estimations, therefore allowing nodes to optimize
  their own duty cycle. Nodes globally converge to a system-wide optimum of a minimal
  network discovery energy cost. Â© 2002-2012 IEEE.'
