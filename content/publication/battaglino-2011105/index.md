abstract: The aim of this work is to present Campus++, a location-based publish-subscribe
  system for intermittently connected delay tolerant networks, exploiting IEEE 802.15.4
  devices, and taking into due account the severe constraints deriving fromtheir physical
  characteristics. We describe our proposed architectural model and how we implemented
  our solution in a real test-bed. We investigate the trade-off between reduction
  of delay and storage requirements when nodes are memory-constrained. We provide
  some insights in this trade-off and propose simple rules to dimension the number
  of replicas per topic. To this end, we derive analytical models and we validate
  them with simulations. We point out that our system can be easily adapted to operate
  in a fully distributed, infrastructureless way, allowing free communications e.g.
  in disaster areas or in areas in which \"usual\" communications means are either
  non existent or intentionally made unavailable. Copyright 2011 ACM.
