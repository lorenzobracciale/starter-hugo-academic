abstract: 'The design of GPS tracking devices and the related data collection infrastructure
  is an old task that still presents several research challenges from both a technical
  and biological point of view. Weight, size, and power consumption of such devices
  must be made compatible with small-sized species so as not to interfere with their
  lives and habits. To target the design of the monitoring device and the data collection
  infrastructure, we choose the Galápagos Pink Land Iguana (Conolophus marthae) as
  a reference case. While the monitoring area is relatively small, the difficulty
  of the terrain, the lack of any available communication infrastructure and hard
  logistics offer several challenges. In this paper we present: (i) the board designed
  and developed by an interdisciplinary collaboration; (ii) the energy budget of the
  WSN device; (iii) the analysis for the selection of the frequency bands. © Springer
