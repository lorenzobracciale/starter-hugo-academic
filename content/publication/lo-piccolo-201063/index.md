abstract: In this paper we focus on wireless proximity technologies, which are attracting
  an ever increasing attention for advantages such as easy integration in user mobile
  phones and terminals, low power consumption and low chipset costs. However, interoperability
  between wireless proximity technologies and IP networks is at a very early stage.
  For instance, the ZigBee protocol stack, which is one of the most widespread protocol
  stack for IEEE 802.15.4 low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs), in
  its current version integrates a network layer not compatible with the IP network
  layer. Thus in this paper, we first of all describe real application scenarios and
  mobile services which demonstrate how mobile phones and terminals integrating some
  kind of wireless proximity technology can take great advantage from the direct interoperability
  with IP networks. Secondly, as proof of concept, we also present a real test-bed
  based on a protocol architecture where IEEE 802.15.4 WPANs nodes and mobile terminals
  are IP-enabled and can interact with the public Internet, and describing real applications
