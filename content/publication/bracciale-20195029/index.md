abstract: "The expected dramatic growth of connected things raises the issue of how\
  \ to efficiently organize them, in order to monitor and manage functions and interactions.\
  \ Information centric networking (ICN) is a communication paradigm that provides\
  \ content-oriented functionality in the network and at the network level, including\
  \ content routing, caching, multicast, mobility, data-centric security, and a flexible\
  \ namespace. Thus, it is a viable solution for supporting Internet of Things (IoT)\
  \ services without requiring any centralized entity. In this paper, we introduce\
  \ the lightweight named object solution: a convenient way to represent physical\
  \ IoT objects in a derived name space, exploiting ICN. We show that this abstraction\
  \ can: 1) increase the programming simplicity; 2) offer extended functionality,\
  \ such as augmentation and upgrading, to cope with the 'software erosion,' and 3)\
  \ implement a common interaction logic involving mutual function invocation. We\
  \ present some proof-of-concept implementations of the proposed abstraction dealing\
  \ with challenging IoT test cases; we also carry out a performance evaluation in\
  \ a simulated network scenario. Â© 2014 IEEE."
