abstract: After a shipwreck people wear life vest and the available telecommunication
  systems for rescue operations offer, in the best case, just approximate localization
  of relicts or lifeboats. A communication system tailored to provide a reliable and
  real time updated map of positions and health conditions of floating people can
  improve efficiency of rescue operation. The aim of the SMARTSOS system is to introduce
  the capability for each person, equipped with GPS receiver and health sensors, to
  send information at low cost to a remote location, maximizing delivery probability
  and quality of service, ensuring also data integrity. Each life vest will be equipped
  with a terminal able to exchange data only with other life vest terminals; a subset
  of all life vests (masters) will be equipped also with very small Low Earth Orbit
  (LEO) 01 GEO satellite terminal to provide long range connectivity; the space segment
  and the remote service center will complete the architecture. To maximize message
  delivery probability and to limit power we propose a joint exploitation of linear
  Network Coding and a store-And-forward mechanism. Each node overhears broadcast
  communications of neighbors, gathers messages and code them with its own message
  to re- broadcast the result with an uucoded copy of its message. On the other side,
  the rescue team will get the position grid and health information of shipwrecked
  people, planning operations accordingly. The paper describes the system architecture
  and a project that will include the design of the Network Coding scheme and its
  validation via simulations and trials with prototypes.
