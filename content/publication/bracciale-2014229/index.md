abstract: Algorithms and protocols for opportunistic, delay tolerant and wireless
  ad-hoc networks are designed and validated by simulating the people interactions
  induced by the nodes mobility. There are cases in which we are interested in simulating
  just the first interaction between a pair of nodes, for instance to assess the performance
  of a discovery or epidemic routing protocol. In this cases nodes rapidly extinguish
  their utility hence it is not convenient to simulate these scenarios using a fixed
  amount of nodes. Thus we present a novel simulation methodology that introduces
  the 'open environment' where nodes enter, can interact through meeting with other
  nodes and then exit, keeping the focus on the environment rather than on what happen
  before and after the nodes stay in the interesting area. The proposed approach uses
  the statistical distribution extracted from the real traces to reproduce directly
  the human interaction pattern without going through the traditional random way point
  approach. Meetings are simulated by a time-varying graph that holds the state of
  the interactions in the environment, while adapting to the statistics of single
  node to its history. We show that even in a simple scenario, the epidemic infection,
  Markov memory-less models have been fairly far from the interaction scenarios that
  the method reproduces. Â© 2014 IEEE.
