abstract: 'In this paper we show how linear network coding can reduce the number of
  queries needed to retrieve one specific message among k distinct ones replicated
  across a large number of randomly accessed nodes storing one message each. Without
  network coding, this would require k queries on average. After proving that no scheme
  can perform better than a straightforward lower bound of 0:5k average queries, we
  propose and asymptotically evaluate, using mean field arguments, a few example practical
  schemes, the best of which attains 0:794k queries on average. The paper opens two
  complementary challenges: a systematic analysis of practical schemes so as to identify
  the best performing ones and design guideline strategies, as well as the need to
  identify tighter, nontrivial, lower bounds. © 2016 AIMS.'
