abstract: 'In this paper we present a Robust data Replication Algorithm (RRA) for
  MANETs. RRA ensures persistent data availability by duplicating data over replicanodes,
  while minimizing the consumption of radio resources. RRA is the first algorithm
  thoroughly designed to operate in environments with node failures and radio obstacles
  (e.g., buildings, walls). Our challenge is to consider such impairments as \"accidental\";
  i.e., their occurrence neither can be run-time predicted, nor can be a-priori quantified
  in terms of probability. As instance, this is the case of nodes wandering in an
  unknown territory. To cope efficiently with the novel challenge, we suggest a practical
  assumption: during a refresh period, only a single accidental impairment may occur.
  Following this assumption, we succeed in formalizing (and solving) the resource
  minimization problem as the finding of a minimum-cost-set-cover. We assess RRA performance
  through NS2 simulations. Simulation code is released as open-source. Â©2010 IEEE.'
