abstract: In this paper we present OPSS, an Overlay Peer-to-peer Streaming Simulator
  designed to simulate large scale (i.e. in the order of 100K nodes) peer-to-peer
  streaming systems. OPSS is able to simulate a fair (i.e. \"TCP-like\") sharing of
  the uplink and downlink bandwidth among different connections, and it guarantees
  extensibility by allowing the implementation of different peer-to-peer streaming
  algorithms as separate modules. Source code of OPSS is available under the GPL license.
