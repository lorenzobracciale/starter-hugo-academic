abstract: 'Many distribution algorithms have been proposed up to now for P2P real
  time streaming. However, due to the lack of basic theoretical results and bounds,
  common sense and intuitions and heuristics have driven their design so far. The
  consequence is that we can find in the literature a large variety of different choices
  about the main aspects of a P2P system, such as overlay topology, scheduling process
  and upload strategy. In this situation, it is difficult to establish unambiguously
  the absolute goodness of a particular algorithm or even the rationale behind a particular
  choice or solution. In this paper we propose and evaluate a theory-driven distribution
  algorithm for P2P real time streaming. We take advantage from a previous theoretical
  study, where: i) we derived a theoretical performance bound for forest-based overlay
  topologies regarding the number of nodes reachable in a given time interval or equivalently
  the time required to reach a given number of nodes; ii) we proved the optimality
  of Streamline, a distribution algorithm based on the serial transmission over forest-based
  topologies, in terms of its capability to reach such a bound. The Streamline algorithm
  is based on some ideal assumptions that prevent its practical implementation. In
  this paper we remove these assumptions and present a practical and working algorithm,
  named Operational Streamline or simply O-Streamline. We also evaluate the performance
  of O-Streamline, comparing them with the optimal bounds of Streamline. Â© 2008 IEEE.'
