abstract: Many vehicular ad-hoc network protocols have been validated using complex
  urban mobility simulators or by means of the few publicly available real mobility
  traces. This work presents an extensive measurement campaign of the positions of
  a fleet of 370 taxi cabs moving around the city of Rome, Italy. Due to its street
  network and its traffic conditions, Rome presents a characteristic mobility pattern
  representative of an ancient city with heavy road congestion, and therefor provides
  a valuable test case to experiment VANET protocols. We exploit these traces to run
  a set of experiments to assess the performance of a simple epidemic protocol that
  we compare with the basic random waypoint model in order to quantify how far the
  performance metrics are from this baseline. The results show the possible outcomes
  of implementing data dissemination through an opportunistic network that uses taxi
  cabs as an information vector. Â© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This
