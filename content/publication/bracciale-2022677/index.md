abstract: Demand response consists in the modification of energy consumption by end
  users to attain specific effects on the electrical grid, namely reduce congestion
  and optimize the usage of renewable energy. When implemented with blockchain, demand
  response poses important privacy concerns since it generally needs the publication
  of sensitive information about users regarding their energy consumption. In this
  work, we devise a system to preserve privacy in such a scenario by using Secure
  Multiparty Computation (SMC) algorithms and a blockchain-based architecture with
  the goal of achieving both accountability and privacy. Â© 2022 IEEE.
