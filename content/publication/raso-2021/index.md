abstract: Besides providing data sharing, commercial cloud-based storage services
  (e.g., Dropbox) also enforce access control, i.e. permit users to decide who can
  access which data. In this paper we advocate the separation between the sharing
  of data and the access control function. We specifically promote an overlay approach
  which provides end-to-end encryption and empowers the end users with the possibility
  to enforce access control policies without involving the cloud provider itself.
  To this end, our proposal, named ABEBox, relies on the careful combination of i)
  attribute-based encryption for custom policy definition and management, with ii)
  proxy re-encryption to provide scalable re-keying and protection to key-scraping
  attacks, with a novel revocation procedure. Moreover, iii) we concretely embed our
  protection mechanisms inside a public domain virtual file system module to provide
  an overlay and trivial-to-use transparent service which can be deployed on top of
  any arbitrary cloud storage provider. Â© 2021 ACM.
