abstract: In this work we assess the delay performance of a Publish Subscribe system
  built on top of a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) composed of nodes with limited storage
  capacities. Many DTN routing protocols replicate the same data over several nodes,
  in order to deliver data to destination in a faster or in a more reliable way. Of
  course, increasing the number of replicas has the effect of decreasing the delivery
  delay perceived by the users, but increases the use of the system memory. Â© 2011
