abstract: "Many Internet of Things applications require a regular periodic sampling\
  \ of physical quantities, such as light, CO2, or position. However, for energy harvesting\
  \ devices, this can be in sharp contrast with the unreliable and time-varying amount\
  \ of energy gathered opportunistically from the environment, and the severe energy\
  \ storage limitations in constrained devices further exacerbate such issue. This\
  \ article proposes an approach devised to jointly optimize frequency and stability\
  \ of the sampling rate in energy harvesting sensors. Unlike heuristic approaches,\
  \ StableSENS builds upon a solid theoretical foundation, namely, Lyapunov optimization,\
  \ which - to the best of our knowledge - is applied here for the first time to the\
  \ sensing scenario. One of StableSENS' main assets is its very broad applicability:\
  \ we remark that neither assumptions nor predictions on future energy availability\
  \ patterns are required. Numerical results obtained in realistic scenarios show\
  \ that StableSENS yields superior performance with respect to previous heuristic\
  \ approaches as well as reinforcement-learning-based approaches. Â© 2014 IEEE."
