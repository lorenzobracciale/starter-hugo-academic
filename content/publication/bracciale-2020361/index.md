abstract: Cryptography key management system plays a very central role in the cloud
  data security. Nonetheless, a great part of the current commercial solutions rely
  on cloud providers that hold both the encrypted data and the related private master
  key of their served customers in their secure key vaults, having a de-facto total
  control on their customer digital assets. Conversely, entrusting customer companies
  for key holding can be dangerous as witnessed by many cases of key loss or theft.
  In this work we present CoProtect, a novel architecture to protect the cryptography
  keys in cloud systems that leverage on the cooperation between the cloud provider
  and the customer company. With such trust model, we present the proposed data management
  strategy, the key generation and the crypto procedures, and a proof of concept.
