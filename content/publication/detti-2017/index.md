abstract: This paper explores methodologies, advantages and challenges related to
  the use of the Information Centric Network technology for developing NoSQL distributed
  databases, which are expected to play a central role in the forthcoming IoT and
  BigData era. ICN services make possible to simplify the development of the database
  software, improve performance, and provide data-level access control. We use our
  findings to design a NoSQL spatio-temporal database, named OpenGeoBase, and evaluate
  its performance by using a real data set relevant to Intelligent Transport System
  applications. Â© 2017 IEEE.
