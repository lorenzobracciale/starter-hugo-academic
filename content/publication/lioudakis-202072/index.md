abstract: This paper outlines the approach followed by the H2020 BPR4GDPR project
  to facilitate GDPR compliance. Its goal is to provide a holistic framework able
  to support end-to-end GDPR-compliant intra- and inter-organisational ICT-enabled
  processes at various scales, while also being generic enough, fulfilling operational
  requirements covering diverse application domains. To this end, solutions proposed
  by BPR4GDPR cover the full process lifecycle addressing major challenges and priorities
  posed by the Regulation. Â© 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.
