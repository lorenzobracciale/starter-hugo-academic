abstract: 'This paper addresses the following foundational question: what is the maximum
  theoretical delay performance achievable by an overlay peer-to-peer streaming system
  where the streamed content is subdivided into chunks? As shown in this paper, when
  posed for chunk-based systems, and as a consequence of the store-and-forward way
  in which chunks are delivered across the network, this question has a fundamentally
  different answer with respect to the case of systems where the streamed content
  is distributed through one or more flows (sub-streams). To circumvent the complexity
  emerging when directly dealing with delay, we express performance in term of a convenient
  metric, called \"stream diffusion metric\".We show that it is directly related to
  the end-to-end minimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous
  scenario, we derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound
  relates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each node,
  and the number of neighbors a node may deliver chunks to. In this bound, k-step
  Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws that characterize
  the optimal operation of chunk-based systems.'
