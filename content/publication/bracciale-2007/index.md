abstract: In this paper we present OPSS, an Overlay Peer-to-peer Streaming Simulator
  designed to simulate a large scale (i.e. in the order of 100K nodes) peer-to-peer
  streaming systems. OPSS is able to simulate a fair (i.e.“TCP-like”) sharing of the
  uplink and downlink bandwidth among different connections, and it guarantees extensibility
  by allowing the implementation of different peer-to-peer streaming algorithms as
  separate modules. Therefore it allows to simulate the behavior of arbitrary tree-based
  or mesh-based approaches. In particular, we implemented two trivial tree-based and
  mesh-based approaches for which we could easily find an analytic model of chunk
  distribution delay. The results of the model have been compared with the simulation
  output, showing an excellent fit. Source code of OPSS is available under the GPL
