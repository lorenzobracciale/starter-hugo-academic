abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are assuming an important role in
  the monitoring and mapping of marine ecosystems, especially for their ability to
  explore harsh environments. AUV swarm can collect data operating autonomously for
  long periods enabling new applications in this field. However, the mission duration
  is usually limited also by the high power consumption required for acoustic transmissions.
  A new generation of devices complements the acoustic modem with an optical modem
  that can provide a communication channel with higher capacity and lower power consumption
  with respect to the acoustic channel. However, the optical link that uses the visible
  light is very sensitive to the water turbidity that can strongly limit the link
  coverage. In this paper, we evaluate the networking performances of the Venus vessel,
  a real AUV prototype equipped with an acoustical modem and an optical modem. The
  presented analysis aims to evaluate key system parameters allowing to select the
  best way to set up network communications according to the surrounding conditions
  (e.g., quality of water) and to the application requirements. Simulation results
  account for the case of ports or basins, where the water quality is poor and the
  use of the optical modem is strongly limited by distance. We evaluate system performance
  in terms of transmission delay in the network and we also provide a power-capacity
  trade-off. Â© 2018 by the authors.
