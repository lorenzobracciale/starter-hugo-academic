abstract: Despite the great interest received by the smartphones in opportunistic
  networks context, the requested energy toll still remains one of the prominent inhibiting
  factors to the real deployment of such technology. In this paper we evaluate a on-off
  approach devised to provide intermittent (but synchronized) WiFi communication across
  opportunistically connected devices while saving energy. Differently form classical
  duty cycle approaches that are implemented at the protocol/network level, we devise
  a \"human time-scale\" duty cycle that can be implemented as an overlay system service
  at the application level. The relatively large time-scale allows to simply keep
  a loose synchronization between terminals, without requiring any changes in the
  default operating system or system internals of commercial mobile phones.With reference
  to Android devices, we analyze the effects of varying such duty cycle in terms of
  the feasibility of the synchronization requirements as well as the energy gain obtained
  in order to find the trade-off for the different state settings. For these values,
  we evaluate the loss of discovered contacts using the data coming from real human
  mobility traces. Â© 2013 IEEE.
