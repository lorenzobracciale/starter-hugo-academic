summary: eBPF/eCLAT Tutorial at NETSOFT 2022
abstract: 'eBPF is definitely a complex technology. Developing complex systems based on eBPF is challenging due to the intrinsic limitations of the model and the known shortcomings of the tool chain.
The learning curve of this technology is very steep and needs continuous coaching from experts. This tutorial will investigate:
1. What is eBPF and why it has gained a prominent position among the solutions to improve the packet processing performance in Linux/x86 nodes. We will shortly present some important use case scenarios for eBPF, like Kubernetes'' Cilium
1. The architecture of eBPF and its programming toolchain (e.g. bcc)
1. What are the frameworks for eBPF programming, such as Polycube and InKeV.
1. How to make eBPF programming easier, more flexible and modular with HIKe/eCLAT
1. How to implement a custom application logic in eBPF with eCLAT using a python-like script
1. How to extend the framework and develop new modules'
