summary: An introduction to blockchain, bitcoin and the related crazy world.
abstract: 'How can a number be worth 40 000 euro? We will try to explain in simple terms what a Bitcoin is starting with how it works and then expanding to other cryptocurrencies. We will try to understand what words like Blockchain, DeFi, NFT and Web3 mean. We will look at the history of this technology and try to interpret the present and imagine the future that awaits us.'
